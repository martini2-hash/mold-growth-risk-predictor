# Mold Growth Risk Predictor

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop an AI-assisted IoT system that monitors
temperature and humidity to assess mold growth risk in indoor environments.

Mold growth is a common issue in homes, apartments, and dorms, especially in
areas with poor ventilation or high humidity. Early awareness of mold-friendly
conditions can help users take preventive action before damage or health risks occur.

This project focuses on **problem-solving using AI tools**, not on building
advanced machine learning models.

## Problem Statement
Mold growth often occurs unnoticed until it becomes visible or causes health
issues. Many people do not continuously monitor indoor humidity and temperature,
which are key contributors to mold growth.

This project aims to provide users with timely insights into environmental
conditions that may increase mold growth risk.

## Project Goals
- Measure temperature and humidity using IoT sensors
- Analyze environmental patterns over time
- Display mold risk levels in a simple web interface
- Use AI tools to assist development, debugging, and learning

## Technologies and Tools (Planned)
### Hardware
- Arduino Nano
- Seeed Studio XIAO ESP32-C6
- AHT10 temperature and humidity sensor
- Breadboard and jumper wires

### Software
- Arduino IDE
- Web dashboard (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
- GitHub for version control

### AI Tools
- AI assistance for coding, debugging, documentation, and planning
- AI-assisted generation of web application components

## Project Scope
This project focuses on identifying mold-friendly environmental conditions
based on sensor data. It does not attempt to diagnose mold presence or health
conditions.

---

## Project Status
This project is currently in the planning and preparation phase.
Development and testing will occur in later sprints.
