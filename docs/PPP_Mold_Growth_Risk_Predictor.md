# Mold Growth Risk Predictor
### AI-Driven IoT System Development
**Project Plan Preparation (PPP)**

**Name:** Idalia Martin
**Course:** CSC 494 - AI-Driven Iot System Development

## Project Overview
**Problem:**
Mold growth is often undetected until it causes helath issues or damage on propety.

**Goal:**
The goal is to develp an IoT-based system that monitors environmental conditions and helps users recognize mold risk through humildity and temperature patterns.

**Approach:**
Use Iot sensors for data collection and AI tools to assist with development, visualization, and analysis.

---

## Why 
Mold causes health issies and property damage, but it is usually detected after the fact that it has already grown. Mold growth depends on **patterns over time**, not a single readings. 
So, this project focuses on **prevention**, and not detection after the fact.

---

## System Concept
1. Sensor collects temperature and humidity data
2. ESP32 logs and transmits data
3. Web application displays:
    - Trends over time
    - Periods of elevated humidity
4. User interprets patterns to asses mold risk

Again, it is a **decision-support system**, not an automated diagnosis.

## Role of AI in This project
AI will help assist with:
- Embedded programming
- Sensor integration
- Web application development
AI will help answer:
- Unexpected sensor behavior
- 

## Sprint 1: Learning & Exploration
**Goals:**
- Interface AHT10 with ESP32
- Collect and log sensor data
- Explore data patterns

**Activities: **
- Use AI tools to learn sensor libraries
- Prototype data logging
- Initial dashboard mockups (I don't know what this means)

---

## Sprint 2: Solution Development
**Goals:**
- Build web application
- Visualize humidity and temperature trends
- Implement basic alerts or indicators

**Activites:** 
- Refine data presentation
- Apply time-based analysis (what does this mean)
- Evaluate system limitations

---

## Conclusion
This project explores how IoT sensing combined with AI-assistence can help users recognize environmental conditions that contribute to mold growth. 

Thank You!
