# Mold Growth Risk Predictor
### AI-Driven IoT System Development  
**Project Plan Preparation (PPP)**

**Name:** Idalia Martin  
**Course:** CSC 494 – AI-Driven IoT System Development

---

## 1. Problem & Why It Matters

### Problem
Mold growth in indoor spaces is often undetected until it causes:
- Health issues
- Property damage
- Costly remediation

### Why This Is Important
- Mold growth depends on **environmental conditions over time**
- Most people do not continuously monitor humidity and temperature
- Early awareness can help **prevent** mold before damage occurs

---

## 2. Project Focus (Team / Topic)

### Project Focus Area
**Sensor + Software Application**

- Sensors collect environmental data
- Software visualizes patterns and trends
- System supports user decision-making

This project focuses on **building applications on top of given hardware**.

---

## 3. System Overview

### High-Level Concept
1. Temperature & humidity sensor collects data  
2. ESP32 logs and transmits readings  
3. Web application displays:
   - Trends over time
   - Periods of elevated humidity  
4. User interprets patterns to assess mold risk

This is a **decision-support system** only.
---

## 4. Role of AI in This Project

AI will be used as a **development and learning assistant**, not as a predictive model.

AI will help with:
- Embedded programming
- Sensor integration and debugging
- Web application development
- Explaining unfamiliar concepts and tools


---

## 5. Learning with AI (Two Topics)

### Hardware Topic (with AI)
- **I2C Communication**
  - Understanding how the AHT10 sensor communicates with the ESP32
  - Using AI to learn datasheets, wiring, and libraries

### Software Topic (with AI)
- **Web Application Development**
  - Building a simple web dashboard
  - Visualizing temperature and humidity trends
  - Using AI to learn frameworks and visualization techniques

---

## 6. Sprint 1 – Learning & Exploration

### What I Need to Learn (Iteration 1)
- How to interface the AHT10 sensor with the ESP32
- How to collect and log data reliably
- How to structure data for visualization

### Activities
- Use AI to learn sensor libraries
- Prototype sensor readings
- Test basic data logging

---

## 7. Sprint 2 – Feature Development

### What I Will Build (Iteration 2)
- Web application dashboard
- Time-based graphs for humidity and temperature
- Basic indicators for elevated humidity conditions

### Activities
- Refine data presentation
- Analyze changes over time
- Evaluate system limitations

---

## 8. Project Scope

### Included
- Environmental monitoring
- Data visualization
- User decision support

### Not Included
- Mold detection or diagnosis
- Medical or health recommendations
- Advanced machine learning models

---

## 9. Final Goal

By the end of the semester, I expect to:
- Build a **working IoT prototype**
- Demonstrate it as part of my **portfolio**
- Use it as a foundation for future extensions

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how IoT sensing and AI-assisted development can help users understand environmental conditions that contribute to mold growth — **before damage occurs**.

Thank you!
