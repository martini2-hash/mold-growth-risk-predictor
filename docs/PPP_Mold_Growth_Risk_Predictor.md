# Mold Growth Risk Predictor
### AI-Driven IoT System Development
**Project Plan Preparation (PPP)**

**Name:** Idalia Martin  
**Course:** CSC 494 - AI-Driven IoT System Development

---

## Project Overview
**Problem:**  
Mold growth is often undetected until it causes health issues or property damage.

**Goal:**  
The goal is to develop an IoT-based system that monitors environmental conditions and helps users recognize mold risk through humidity and temperature patterns.

**Approach:**  
Use IoT sensors for data collection and AI tools to assist with development, visualization, and analysis.

---

## Why
Mold causes health issues and property damage, but it is usually detected after it has already grown.  
Mold growth depends on **patterns over time**, not a single reading.  

This project focuses on **prevention**, not post-fact detection.

---

## System Concept
1. Sensor collects temperature and humidity data  
2. ESP32 logs and transmits data  
3. Web application displays:
    - Trends over time
    - Periods of elevated humidity  
4. User interprets patterns to assess mold risk  

It is a **decision-support system**, not an automated diagnosis.

---

## Metrics for Progress
Project progress will be evaluated using:
- Successful collection of temperature and humidity data  
- Ability to log and store data over time  
- Clear visualization of trends in the web application  
- Completion of sprint goals within the planned timeline

---

## Role of AI in This Project
AI tools will assist with:
- Embedded programming and sensor integration  
- Debugging unexpected sensor behavior  
- Web application development and data visualization  
- Explaining unfamiliar concepts during development  

AI is used as a development and learning assistant, **not** as a machine learning model for prediction or diagnosis.

---

## Sprint 1: Learning & Exploration
**Goals:**
- Interface AHT10 sensor with ESP32  
- Collect and log sensor data  
- Explore data patterns

**Activities:**
- Use AI tools to learn sensor libraries  
- Prototype data logging  
- Initial dashboard layout planning  

---

## Sprint 2: Solution Development
**Goals:**
- Build web application  
- Visualize humidity and temperature trends  
- Implement basic alerts or indicators

**Activities:**
- Refine data presentation  
- Analyze changes in humidity and temperature over time  
- Evaluate system limitations  

---

## Project Scope
**Included:**
- Monitoring temperature and humidity  
- Visualizing environmental trends  
- Supporting user decision-making

**Not Included:**
- Mold detection or diagnosis  
- Health or medical recommendations  
- Advanced machine learning models

## Conclusion
This project explores how IoT sensing combined with AI assistance can help users recognize environmental conditions that contribute to mold growth.
